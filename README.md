# Kickstarter-prediction

In this project, I build a Random Forest model to predict the amount of real USD pledged for a KickStarter Project.

This project is done as implementation of the lessons from fast.ai Machine Learning course

The dataset is available on Kaggle via: https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects
